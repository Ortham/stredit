<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>StrEdit is a minimalist editor of the string table files that TES V: Skyrim plugins use to provide support for multiple languages. StrEdit can be used to create or update translations of string tables, without requiring their associated plugin to be present.
<p>StrEdit does not contain any plugin localisation or delocalisation functionality, ie. you need to create the string tables before StrEdit can be used to edit them. <a href="http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859/">TES5Edit</a> is recommended for doing that.

<h2 id="install">Installation &amp; Uninstallation</h2>
<p>To install, extract the <q>StrEdit</q> folder from the downloaded archive to a location of your choice.
<p>To uninstall, delete the <q>StrEdit</q> folder you previously extracted.

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>StrEdit is launched by running the <q>StrEdit.exe</q> found in the StrEdit folder. On launch, the <q>Open File(s)...</q> dialog, shown below, is displayed.
<img alt="open files" src="images/open-files.png"/>
<p>The translation file is optional, and should be used if updating an existing translation. The source file must always be specified, and if a translation file is also specified, it must be exactly the same file as was used to create the translation from.
<p>The drop-down menus to the right of the file pickers are for selecting the fall-back encoding that should be used when reading the string tables. The string tables are assumed to contain strings encoded in UTF-8, but if a string is not valid when read as UTF-8, the fall-back encoding will be used. The encodings available for selection are:
<ul>
    <li><b>Windows-1252.</b> This is the default and should be used for all string tables except those that are for Cyrillic alphabet languages, such as Russian.
    <li><b>Windows-1251.</b> This should be used for string tables that are for Cyrillic alphabet languages, such as Russian.
</ul>

<p>Once StrEdit has opened the file(s) selected, it will display its main window:
<img alt="main window" src="images/main.png"/>
<p>The main window consists of four primary elements:
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Element<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Filter Box<td>This box can be used to filter the list of strings. Entering text into this box then pressing <q>Enter</q> or clicking the magnifying glass icon will filter out any rows in the String List that do not have original strings that start with the same text. Clicking the cancel icon or clearing the text then pressing enter or clicking the magnifying glass icon will remove the filter. The status bar will give a count of how many strings are being filtered when a filter is applied.
        <tr><td>String List<td>This is the list of all the strings in the loaded source string table. Clicking on a row will put its original and new strings into their respective boxes. For rows that contain an original and new string that were matched inexactly, the <q>Fuzzy</q> column will be ticked. Rows which have had their new string edited are highlighted in blue.
        <tr><td>Original String Box<td>Displays the text in the <q>Original String</q> column of the selected row. This text is non-editable.
        <tr><td>New String Box<td>When a row is selected, this box is filled with the text in its <q>New String</q> column. Any edits made are applied to that row when another row is selected.
</table>
<p>To translate the strings, simply select a row, enter your translation into the new string box, then select the next row and repeat until all original strings have been translated. Keyboard navigation using the tab and arrow keys is supported, as are the usual shortcuts for saving and undoing work.
<p>Selecting a row then pressing <kbd>Alt+C</kbd> will paste the original string into the new string box, then move keyboard focus to it.
<p>Once you have finished working, select <q>File->Save</q> or <q>File->Save As...</q> to save your work. If you attempt to quit with unsaved work, StrEdit will ask you if you want to save it before quitting. For simplicity and greatest compatibility, StrEdit saves all string tables with their strings encoded in UTF-8.

<h3>Machine Translation</h3>
<p>StrEdit can be used to perform a machine translation of any untranslated strings in the current file by selecting <q>File->Perform Machine Translation...</q>. This will display the following window:
<img alt="machine translation window" src="images/vocab-select.png"/>
<p>The machine translation uses a vocabulary of previously-translated string pairs to find the closest translations for untranslated strings, and it is in this window that you select the pairs of string tables to be used to generate this vocabulary. Clicking on the <q>Add</q> button will display the <q>Open File(s)</q> dialog, in which you may pick a source file and a corresponding translation. Clicking the <q>Remove</q> button will remove the currently-selected row from the file list.
<p>Once you have selected all the file pairs you wish to use as a vocabulary, click the <q>OK</q> button. StrEdit will then scan through all your untranslated strings, matching each one up to the closest translation available in the vocabulary. If an exact translation cannot be found, then the next-closest match will be used, and the match will be marked as <q>fuzzy</q> in the main window's string list. Note that this step can take a long time, depending on the number of strings to be scanned through and the number of string pairs in the vocabulary.
<p>Machine translations may be used to quickly perform a rough translation of a string table, or alternatively they can be used to update a translation to match a newer version of its source file. This is done by opening the newer source file in StrEdit's main window, then selecting the old source file and the translation as a vocabulary file pair, and performing a machine translation with them.

<p>Thanks go to shadeMe and zilav for answering some questions I had during development.
<p>StrEdit's interface is inspired by <a href="http://poedit.net/">Poedit's</a> interface.
<p>StrEdit is written in C++ and makes use of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>, <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>, <a href="http://github.com/WrinklyNinja/libstrings">libstrings</a> and <a href="http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/index.html">TinyXML-2</a> libraries. Without them, it would not exist.

<h2 id="history">Version History</h2>
<h3>v0.3 - <i>14 December 2012</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a quick copy/paste keboard shortcut, Alt+C, that copies the original string of the selected row into the new string text box then moves keyboard focus to it.
    <li>Implemented vocabulary and machine translation support.
</ul>
<h3>v0.2.2 - <i>9 December 2012</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed the path edits are saved to not being reset when a new file is opened.
    <li>Opening three files (source, translation and updated source) now merges 'up' to the updated source, rather than 'down' to the original source, so that the result is that each updated source string, is given a translation string, rather than each translation string being given an updated source string. This also enables the source and translation to be used as 'vocabulary' string files, and not necessarily be related to the updated source file.
    <li>Fixed rows that contain strings with non-latin characters being marked as edited when unselected and no changes were made.
</ul>
<h3>v0.2.1 - <i>1 December 2012</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Edited rows are now highlighted in blue, not red.
    <li>libstrings updated to v1.1.1, fixing an extra string being displayed for most string tables.
    <li>Fixed application data, such as edited text, filter status and selected row, not being cleared on opening a new file.
    <li>Fixed StrEdit not closing properly on exit.
</ul>
<h3>v0.2.0 - <i>29 November 2012</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The number of filtered strings is now given in the status bar when a filter is applied.
    <li>Added error messages for when an invalid combination of tables is opened.
    <li>libstrings updated to v1.1:
    <ul>
        <li>String table encodings are now handled correctly.
        <li>String table extension checks are now case-insensitive, fixing an issue where tables previously extracted from BSAs could not be opened.
    </ul>
    <li>Added fall-back encoding selection to the Open File(s) dialog.
</ul>
<h3>v0.1.0 - <i>27 November 2012</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Initial release.
</ul>
