<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>StrEdit is a minimalistic editor of the .STRINGS, .ILSTRINGS and .DLSTRINGS files that TES V: Skyrim plugins use to provide support for multiple languages. StrEdit can be used to create or update translations of strings files, without requiring their associated plugin to be present.
<p>StrEdit does not contain any plugin localisation or delocalisation functionality, ie. you need to create the strings files before StrEdit can be used to edit them. <a href="http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859/">TES5Edit</a> is recommended for doing that.

<h2 id="install">Installation &amp; Uninstallation</h2>
<p>To install, extract the <q>StrEdit</q> folder from the downloaded archive to a location of your choice.
<p>To uninstall, delete the <q>StrEdit</q> folder you previously extracted.

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>StrEdit is launched by running the <q>StrEdit.exe</q> found in the StrEdit folder. On launch, the <q>Open File(s)...</q> dialog, shown below, is displayed. The next step is the most complicated part of using StrEdit, so read on carefully.

</figure>
<p>There are three ways for StrEdit to load translation files, based on what combination of files you open. The valid combinations are:
<ul>
    <li><b>Source file only</b>: The source file opened will, as the name suggests, be used as the source of the original strings. Use this option if you wish to create a translation strings file from scratch.
    <li><b>Source and Translation files</b>: The original strings are obtained from the source file, and the translated strings are obtained from the translation file. The strings are matched up using their IDs, so this option should only be used when updating a translation file using the same version of the source file as was used to create it.
    <li><b>Source, Translation and Updated Source files</b>: The original strings are obtained from the source file, the translated strings are obtained from the translation file, and the string IDs are obtained from the updated source file. If an exact match for a string in the source file cannot be found in the updated source file, the string will be assigned the ID of the closest-matching string, and the distance of the match will be given in the main display so that the user can see which matches are inexact. This option should be used when updating a translation file using a source file that has changed since the translation file was created.
</ul>
<p>The following example should hopefully clarify any confusion arising from the above:
<blockquote>
<p>Alice releases v1.0 of AliceMod, which consists of AliceMod.esp and AliceMod_English.STRINGS.
<p>Bob decides that he wants to translate AliceMod into German, so he opens AliceMod_English.STRINGS in StrEdit as the source file. After translating half the strings, he gets bored and decides to finish the translation later, so closes StrEdit, saving his changes as AliceMod_German.STRINGS.
<p>When Bob goes back to finish off the translation, he opens AliceMod_English.STRINGS and AliceMod_German.STRINGS in StrEdit as the source and translation files respectively. He then finishes the translation, saving it once more as AliceMod_German.STRINGS.
<p>Alice then releases v1.1 of AliceMod, which adds some new strings and some fixes to typos that were present in v1.0. Because the strings file in v1.1 is not the same as the strings file in v1.0, Bob must update his translation before he can use it with v1.1.
<p>Bob opens the v1.0 AliceMod_English.STRINGS and AliceMod_German.STRINGS and the v1.1 AliceMod_English.STRINGS in StrEdit as the source, translation and updated source files respectively. Because the strings with the fixed typos are not exactly the same as the strings in the v1.0 source file, StrEdit will match them inexactly with the existing translations. Bob then checks that these matches are correct, making any changes if required, and adds translations for the new strings. He then saves his translation again as AliceMod_German.STRINGS, and can now use his translation with AliceMod v1.1.
</blockquote>
<p>Once StrEdit has opened the strings file(s) selected, it will display its main window:
<figure>
<img alt="main window" src="images/main.png"/>
<figcaption>The main window.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main window consists of four elements:
<ul>
    <li><b>Filter Box</b>: Entering text into this box then pressing <q>Enter</q> or clicking the magnifying glass icon will filter out any rows in the String List that do not have original strings that start with the same text. Clicking the cancel icon or clearing the text then pressing enter or clicking the magnifying glass icon will remove the filter.
    <li><b>String List</b>: Clicking on a row will put its original and new strings into their respective boxes. Rows containing new strings which have been edited will be displayed in red text. For rows that contain an original and new string that were matched inexactly, the <q>Fuzzy</q> column will display the Levenshtein distance between the two strings a number for any rows that contain an original and a new string that were matched inexactly, with lower numbers being a closer match.
    <li><b>Original String Box</b>: Displays the text in the <q>Original String</q> column of the selected row. This text is non-editable.
    <li><b>New String Box</b>: When a row is selected, this box is filled with the text in its <q>New String</q> column. Any edits made are applied to that row when another row is selected.
</ul>
<p>To translate the strings, simply select a row, enter your translation into the new string box, then select the next row and repeat until all original strings have been translated.
<p>Once you have finished working, select <q>File->Save</q> or <q>File->Save As...</q> to save your work. If you attempt to quit with unsaved work, StrEdit will ask you if you want to save it before quitting.
<p>That's pretty much all there is to it.
